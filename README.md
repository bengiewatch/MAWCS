Multimodal Adaptive Wireless Control System -  MAWCS
This project describes a Multimodal Adaptive Wireless Control System (MAWCS) to help individuals with disabilities and elders with the help of Assistive  Robotic Arm (ARA). The  proposed system uses a wearable and wireless body sensor network (WBSN) supporting up to six sensor nodes to measure the natural upper-body gesture and a speech recognition module to recognise the voice of the users and translate it into control commands. Natural gesture of the head and upper-body parts, as well as muscular activity are measured using Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and surface electromyography (sEMG) using custom-designed multimodal wireless sensor nodes.  An IMU sensing node is attached to a headset worn by the user along with a microphone.
